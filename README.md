Hello Everyone at **Fuze.cc**! It’s a pleasure to speak with you.

In this repository, you’ll find my work from the past week implementing the test you proposed. Here are some key points I’d like to highlight:
- The chosen UI framework is SwiftUI.
- I used the MVVM architecture because it works very well with SwiftUI and makes the architecture easy to understand when looking at the SwiftUI code.
- I decided not to use third-party libraries, not even for image caching, as I wanted to challenge myself.

To run the project:
- Download the repo.
- Open the `.xcodeproj` file.
- Run the app on a simulator or a real device.

Thank you so much for the opportunity, and I hope we chat soon.
